Cross-validation is the process of splitting the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on some folds and testing it on the remaining ones, which provides a more reliable estimate of how the model generalizes to unseen data.

# ML Cross Vlidation 
This project demonstrates the second step in building a Machine Learning pipeline: applying **cross-validation** to evaluate model performance. This technique splits the dataset into multiple folds, training and testing the model across different partitions.  It provides a more reliable estimate of model performance compared to a single train/test split.
