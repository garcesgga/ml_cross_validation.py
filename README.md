# ml_cross_validation.py
In this project we use Cross-Validation, we apply k-fold cross-validation using `scikit-learn`.   This technique splits the dataset into multiple folds, training and testing the model across different partitions.  It provides a more reliable estimate of model performance compared to a single train/test split..
